# Lab2_Geog458

I used geosearch_keyword_stayhome.ipynb to collect all the data from twitter.com.

All the tweets were collected worldwide at the evening of 4/19/2020 (the collecting period is 10 mins) with keywords "stayhome".

It could help us to understand during the COVID-19 pandemic, where were the people using the stayhome hashtag or talked about stayhome and answered WHO call to stay at home.

After visualized the data on the map, it looks like this. Each green camp icon means one tweet with a 'stayhome' keyword.

As you can see that most tweets were from Asia and Africa. It probably that my collecting time is around 10:30 p.m., and most people in the American time zone were sleeping. According to my map, I am glad to see people are talking seriously about this pandemic and understand how important to stay home during the special period. Even though it was only ten minutes, there were still a lot of tweets about it.
