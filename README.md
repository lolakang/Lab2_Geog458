# Lab2_Geog458

I used geosearch_keyword_stayhome.ipynb to collect all the data from twitter.com.

All the tweets were collected worldwide at the evening of 4/19/2020 (the collecting period is 10 mins) with keywords "stayhome".

It could help us to understand during the COVID-19 pandemic, where were the people using the stayhome hashtag or talked about stayhome and answered WHO call to stay at home.

After visualized the data on the map, it looks like this. Each green camp icon means one tweet with a 'stayhome' keyword.
